CodeAlpha Task 1 – Iris Flower Classification Report
Submitted by: Madiha Rehan  
Task: Build a classification model to predict the species of Iris flowers.

 Tools Used:
1. Python  
2. pandas  
3. scikit-learn  
4. Google Colab

 Steps Performed:
✅ Loaded the Iris dataset using seaborn  
✅ Verified that the dataset has no missing values  
✅ Split the data into training and testing sets (80/20 ratio)  
✅ Trained a **Logistic Regression** model using scikit-learn  
✅ Made predictions and evaluated the model using accuracy and classification report  
✅ Visualized results using a confusion matrix  

 Result:

Model Used: Logistic Regression  
Accuracy Achieved: 100% (1.0)  
Precision, Recall, F1-Score: All 1.00 for each species  
Target Labels: setosa, versicolor, virginica  
Test Samples: 30  
Confusion Matrix: Perfect (no misclassifications)  

 Conclusion:
The model successfully predicted all test samples without any error, demonstrating excellent classification performance. This project confirms a strong understanding of classification in machine learning using Python and scikit-learn.
